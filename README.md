# openpgp-keys-filterlists

OpenPGP keys filter lists maintained by [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/). These OpenPGP key lists allow software developers, security analysts or
operators to filter OpenPGP keys based on the filter list following the respective category.

There are currently 3 categories of filter list:

## Trusted list

A list of trusted OpenPGP key fingerprints.

## Blacklist

A list of abused OpenPGP key fingerprints (e.g. such as fake keys, short key-id collision).

- [blacklist](./lists/blacklist/fingerprint.json)

## Privacy list

A list of OpenPGP key fingerprints where the owners requested a removal due to privacy reasons.

# How to update or modify the list?

You can either propose a pull-request to the repository (which will be evaluated by CIRCL) or you can [directly contact CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/contact/).
